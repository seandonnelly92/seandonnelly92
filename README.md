### Hi, I'm Sean ðŸ‘‹

Software Engineer with 5 yearsâ€™ experience building B2C and B2B tech products for the charity sector as a non-technical startup founder. I led Product, UX, User Research, Sales, Marketing, Fundraising, Management and Compliance. Exceptionally adaptable and resilient. Proactive problem-solver that enjoys big challenges. Recently graduated from Le Wagon's intensive coding bootcamp where I built a comprehensive understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Ruby through project-based learning. This solidified my love of coding, and I am now excited to pursue a career in Software Engineering. Looking for a forward-thinking organisation that can benefit from my unique blend of product and technical expertise.
